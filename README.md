Features
* Real-Time Network Status: Displays current ping, external and internal IP addresses.
* TCP Auto-Tuning: Allows users to enable or disable TCP Window Auto-Tuning to manage buffer sizes dynamically.
* Receive-Side Scaling (RSS): Provides options to enable or disable RSS for better CPU load distribution during network packet processing.
* Speed Test Integration: Links to external speed test services such as Speedtest.net and Fast.com for measuring network speeds.
* BufferBloat Test: Provides a quick link to perform a bufferbloat test via waveform.com.
* Ping and IP Update: Real-time updates of ping and IP addresses.
* Status Display: Shows the status of TCP Auto-Tuning and RSS in real-time.

Technical Details
Programming Language: C#
Framework: .NET Framework (requires installation on the target machine)
IDE: Visual Studio
Network Management: Uses Windows' netsh commands for network configuration
Ping and IP Retrieval: Implements System.Net.NetworkInformation for network interface data and ping commands

How to Use
Download and Install: Ensure you have the .NET Framework installed on your machine.
Run the Application: Execute the application, and you will see the main interface with various buttons and status displays.

Optimize Your Network:
Click on Normal Auto-Tuning or Disable Auto-Tuning to manage TCP Window Auto-Tuning.
Use Enable RSS or Disable RSS to control Receive-Side Scaling.
Speedtest.net and Fast.com buttons will open your default browser to their respective speed test pages.
BufferBloat Test will link you to waveform.com for a bufferbloat test.
Check Real-Time Status: The status section at the top of the window provides real-time updates of your network settings, ping, and IP addresses.
