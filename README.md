Graphical user interface (GUI) application written in Python using the PyQt5 library. The application, named "Anti-BufferBloat 1.5", aims to manage the Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level (RWAT) on a Windows system to potentially improve network performance.

Here's a breakdown of the functionalities:

Main functionalities:

* Activates/deactivates Receive Window Auto-Tuning (RWAT) to potentially mitigate bufferbloat.
* Shows the current RWAT level.
* Displays real-time ping information.
* Opens links to various internet speed testing websites.

Technical aspects:

* Uses subprocess module to execute commands like netsh and ping.
* PyQt5 library is used for building the graphical user interface.
* A separate thread is used to update the ping information in real-time.
* The code includes basic error handling using try-except blocks.

Points to note:

Modifying system settings like RWAT can potentially impact network performance and stability. It's recommended to proceed with caution and understand the potential consequences before using this application.
The code doesn't directly implement any anti-bufferbloat algorithms. It simply changes a system setting that might be related to bufferbloat under specific conditions.
It's important to consult with network specialists or refer to official documentation before making any significant changes to network configurations.
